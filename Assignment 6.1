Problem statement 2:
Find out the number of people undertaken the trips from the places MIA and HOU

SOLUTION:
For this problem, instead of creating separate project for every task, all 3 tasks are implemented in a single project. So this project 
has 3 Mapper classes and 1 Reducer class as the functionality of reducer is the same for every task. Also, the driver class has 3 Job objects
corresponding to 3 MapReduce jobs which are being executed.
Figures attached.
